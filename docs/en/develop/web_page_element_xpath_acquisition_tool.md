# Web Element XPath Retrieval Tool

Use Ctrl+Click to obtain the XPath of a single element.

Use Shift+Click to obtain the XPath of a set of elements.

To enhance the adaptability of the XPath, you can load the page multiple times and select the same element, ultimately obtaining the most universal XPath.

After retrieving the XPath, save both the page content and the XPath to the history list. Then, merge the list to derive the most universal XPath that can match the element across all pages.
