# Else if conditions branch

Used in combination with an If branch or other Else If branches. When the previous conditional branches are not satisfied, continue to check whether the current branch condition is met. If it is, execute all the included instructions.

This instruction is similar to the [Else If Branch Instruction](else_if.md), but it supports simultaneously checking whether multiple conditions meet the specified relationships.
